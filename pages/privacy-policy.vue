    <p>
      As of the date of this Privacy Policy, six states—California, Colorado,
      Connecticut, Nevada, Utah and Virginia—have enacted comprehensive consumer
      data privacy laws. The laws have several provisions in common, such as the
      right to access and delete personal information and to opt-out of the sale
      of personal information, among others. The following is a brief synopsis
      of those laws. If you are a resident of any of these states, we advise you
      to familiarize yourself with the laws that applies to your situation and
      access it in the event you have any questions not answered here.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      California: The California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA” (California
      Civil Code Section 1798.83) permits users of the Website that are
      California residents to request certain information regarding our
      disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct
      marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact
      hello@fictionalweb.com.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The CCPA provides consumers residing in California certain rights
      regarding their personal information. If you are a California resident,
      you may have the right to request to know more about the categories and
      specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, and disclose,
      request deletion of your personal information, opt out of sale of your
      personal information (if any), and not be discriminated against for
      exercising these rights.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      You or your authorized agent may make these requests by contacting us at
      hello@fictionalweb.com. Note that we may ask you for additional
      information to help us verify your identity before we complete your
      request. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask
      for evidence that you gave that person authority to submit requests to
      exercise rights on your behalf. We will not discriminate against you if
      you exercise your rights under the CCPA.

      right to correct inaccuracies in their data; the right to request deletion
      of their data; the right to obtain a copy of their data; and the right to

      sign into law comprehensive consumer privacy legislation. Most provisions
      of the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA) went into effect on July 1,
      2023, along with the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) on the same day.

      legislation. The UCPA establishes consumers' rights around access,
      deletion, portability, and provides for the right to opt-out of targeted
      advertising and sale of personal data. The UCPA became effective Dec. 21,
      2023. Consumers may request to access the personal data that a controller
      processes about them, delete personal data that the consumer provided to
      the controller, obtain a copy of the personal data, in a "portable"
      format, that the consumer provided to the controller, and opt out of the
      "sale" of personal data (defined as disclosure by a controller to a third
      party for monetary consideration) or processing of personal data for
      targeted advertising.

      Virginia: On March 2, 2021, Virginia's legislature passed the Consumer
      Data Protection Act (CDPA, the Act), which went into effect on January 1,

      personal information, including the right to access their data, correct
      inaccuracies in their data, request deletion of their data, receive a copy
      of their data, and opt out of the processing of their personal data for
